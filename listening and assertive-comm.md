## Question 1: Steps/Strategies for Active Listening

1. **Give Your Full Attention:** When someone is speaking to you, focus on them and their words. Minimize distractions and maintain eye contact.

2. **Show That You're Listening:** Use non-verbal cues like nodding and smiling to demonstrate your attentiveness. It encourages the speaker to continue.

3. **Paraphrase and Repeat:** Rephrase what the speaker said to confirm understanding. This helps clarify any misunderstandings.

4. **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Encourage the speaker to elaborate by asking open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer.

5. **Avoid Interrupting:** Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts before responding. Interrupting can be seen as disrespectful.

6. **Empathize and Validate:** Acknowledge the speaker's feelings and emotions. Show empathy to connect on a deeper level.

## Question 5: Switching to Passive Communication Style

I may switch to a passive communication style when I want to avoid conflict or when I feel that expressing my opinions may not lead to a productive outcome. It can happen in situations where I'm not assertive enough.

## Question 6: Switching to Aggressive Communication Style

I may switch to an aggressive communication style when I feel frustrated or threatened, and I want to assert my opinions forcefully. This can happen when I'm not managing my emotions well.

## Question 7: Switching to Passive-Aggressive Communication Style

Passive-aggressive communication may surface when I want to express my dissatisfaction indirectly, such as through sarcasm or subtle taunts, instead of directly addressing the issue.

By applying these steps, I can communicate assertively and effectively.
